          <h1>5 Research-Backed Study Techniques</h1>
          <ol>
            <li><span class="bold-titles">Pre-test.</span><br>
              <span>When students practice answering questions, even incorrectly, before
                learning the content, their future learning is enhanced. Research has shown that
                pre-testing improves post-test results more than spending the same amount of time
                studying.</span>
            </li>

            <li><span class="bold-titles">Spaced practice.</span><br>
              <span>Spacing out study sessions—focusing on a topic for a short period
                on different days—has been shown to improve retention and recall more than massed practice.
                The book How We Learn explains that spaced practice can feel difficult due to an initial
                forgetting of knowledge—reacquiring that knowledge takes effort.</span>
            </li>
            <li><span class="bold-titles">Self-quizzing.</span><br>
              <span>Testing has a negative connotation in this era of standardized testing,
                but it is a form of active retrieval practice. Encourage students to make test questions
                for themselves as they learn a new concept, thinking about the types of questions you might
                ask on a quiz or test. They should incorporate these quizzes into their study sessions,
                answering every question, even those they believe they know well.</span>
            </li>

            <li><span class="bold-titles">Interleaving practice.</span><br>
              <span>Students may rely on blocked practice, studying a set of
                problems—such as multiplication problems—as a group until they feel mastery. A more effective
                method of studying is to work on a set of problems that are related but not all of the same
                kind—for example, a set of math word problems that call for addition, subtraction,
                multiplication, or division. The consecutive problems cannot be solved with the same strategy.
                This is more effective than doing one multiplication problem after another.</span>
            </li>

            <li><span class="bold-titles">Paraphrasing and reflecting.</span><br>
              <span>Many of us have read a few paragraphs in a textbook only
                to realize that we didn’t retain a single concept or key point presented in those paragraphs.
                To show your students how to combat this, have them utilize intentional learning strategies.
                These include relating what is being learned to prior knowledge, thinking about how they would
                explain the content to a 5-year-old, and reflecting on and asking questions about the content.</span>
